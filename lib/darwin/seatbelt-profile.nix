# lib/seatbelt-profile.nix — static Seatbelt (sandbox-exec) profile rules for
# mkDarwinSandbox. Per-closure store-path rules are appended at Nix build time
# by the runCommand builder in default.nix.
#
# Arguments:
#   networkRulesStr      — (allow network*) or restricted-proxy rules
#   nixSupportRulesStr   — Nix daemon socket + full-store exec rules when
#                          allowNix is set; empty string otherwise
#   allowReadWriteExecStr — per-rwDir allow rules  (subpath, file-read/write/exec)
#   allowFilesStr        — per-rwFile allow rules  (literal, file-read/write)
#   allowReadOnlyStr      — per-roDir allow rules  (subpath, file-read*; no exec)
#   allowFilesReadOnlyStr — per-roFile allow rules (literal, file-read*)

  ;; the full argv+envp of any host-UID process — a complete exfil path
  ;; for env-var secrets the host shell has set (CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN,
  ;; GITHUB_TOKEN, AWS_*, …) before launching the sandbox. The integer-
  ;; MIB form of sysctl(2) resolves to the same canonical names
  ;; internally, so the name-deny catches both sysctl() and sysctlbyname()
  ;; callers. seatbelt is last-match-wins, so the denies override the
  ;; blanket allow.

  ;; Host-identifying single OIDs (kern.hostname, kern.uuid, hw.model,
