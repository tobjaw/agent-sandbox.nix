/*
  mkDarwinSandbox — wraps a binary using macOS Seatbelt (sandbox-exec).

  Seatbelt uses a deny-default policy: everything is forbidden unless an
  explicit (allow ...) rule permits it. This is the inverse of bubblewrap's
  model (build an empty mount tree, then add things). Here the full
  filesystem is always visible to the kernel, but the sandbox blocks
  syscalls that access forbidden paths.

  The policy is a Scheme-like DSL compiled to a .sb file at Nix build
  time. Runtime values (CWD, HOME, GIT_DIR, etc.) are injected via
  sandbox-exec -D NAME=VALUE parameters and referenced as (param "NAME")
  in the profile.

  ## Policy structure (the .sb profile)

    (deny default)           — baseline: block everything
    (allow process-exec)     — allow exec() so the agent can run tools
    (allow process-fork)     — allow fork() for subprocesses
    (allow signal)           — allow sending/receiving signals
    (allow sysctl-read)      — allow reading kernel tuning values, with
                               explicit denies for kern.proc.*,
                               kern.procargs and kern.procargs2 — the
                               last of which is the env-var extraction
                               primitive that would otherwise expose
                               every host process's argv+envp via
                               sysctl({1,49,pid}) (KERN_PROCARGS2)

    Mach IPC:
      Scoped to system services that most programs need. Each
      (allow mach-lookup (global-name ...)) opens one IPC channel.
      - com.apple.system.*           — core OS services
      - com.apple.SystemConfiguration.* — network config (SCDynamicStore)
      - com.apple.securityd.xpc      — Security framework (TLS, certs)
      - com.apple.SecurityServer      — keychain authorization
      - com.apple.trustd.agent        — certificate trust evaluation
      - com.apple.FSEvents            — filesystem event monitoring
      If the agent hangs or gets "bootstrap_look_up failed", a needed
      Mach service is probably missing from this list.

    Network:
      (allow network*) — fully open; no port/host restrictions.

    Device nodes & TTY:
      /dev/null, /dev/urandom, /dev/random, /dev/zero for reads.
      /dev/ptmx and /dev/fd/* for pty allocation and fd-numbered access.
      The pty slave (/dev/ttysNNN) is restricted to the single tty the
      wrapper was launched on, injected as -D MY_TTY=<path> and
      referenced by the profile as (param "MY_TTY"). When stdin is not
      a tty the wrapper passes /nonexistent-tty so no slave is reachable.
      /dev/tty itself is NOT allowed — it lets a process bypass piped
      stdin to talk to the human and is the classic vector for
      escape-sequence / TIOCSTI injection into the parent shell. The
      legacy BSD pty families (/dev/pty*, /dev/ttyp*, /dev/ttyq*,
      /dev/ttyr*) are also omitted; modern macOS uses /dev/ptmx +
      /dev/ttysNNN exclusively.

    System libraries:
      /usr/lib, /usr/share, /System — Apple frameworks and dylibs.
      These are read-only. Without them, almost nothing runs on macOS.
      /Library/Preferences is intentionally NOT allowed: its plists leak
      host identity (hostname, MAC addresses, paired Bluetooth devices,
      recent users, WiFi rotation key material).

    Nix store:
      Only the closure of allowedPackages and pkg is readable/executable.
      Individual store paths are allowed via per-path rules generated at
      Nix build time (not the entire /nix tree).

    DNS / TLS / identity:
      /etc/resolv.conf (and /private/etc/resolv.conf — macOS uses
      /private/etc as the real location, with /etc as a symlink).
      /etc/ssl + /private/etc/ssl for certificate bundles.
      /etc/passwd + /private/etc/passwd for user identity lookups.

    Security framework (keychain & trust):
      /Library/Keychains — system keychain (root CA trust anchors).
      /private/var/db/mds — security framework metadata caches (the
      "MDS" directory). Without this, SecTrustEvaluate may fail with
      errSecInternalComponent, breaking all TLS connections.
      /private/var/run/systemkeychaincheck.done — signals keychain
      migration is complete.

    Temp directories:
      /tmp, /private/tmp, and $TMPDIR (injected as /tmp via -D).
      All are read-write. The per-user /private/var/folders tree —
      where confstr(_CS_DARWIN_USER_TEMP_DIR / _CACHE_DIR) resolves
      to — is intentionally NOT allowed: it holds host-user secrets
      (age keys, PATs, etc.) reachable because sandbox-exec can't
      drop UID. Tools must respect $TMPDIR.

    Ephemeral HOME:
      HOME is redirected to a temp directory under /tmp (covered by
      the existing /tmp subpath allow). This prevents subprocesses
      from reading or writing the real home directory. State paths
      that live under the real HOME are symlinked into the sandbox
      HOME so that $HOME-relative lookups resolve through to the
      real (Seatbelt-allowed) targets. The temp directory is cleaned
      up on exit via a trap. rwDirs and rwFiles are resolved
      to absolute paths before HOME is reassigned.

    Timezone:
      /private/var/db/timezone — so date/time formatting works.

    Filesystem traversal (stat on parent dirs):
      "/" gets file-read* (process startup requires readdir on root).
      All others — /var, /private, /private/var, /Users,
      $REAL_HOME, $REPO_ROOT_PARENT — get file-read-metadata only
      (literal paths, not subpath). This allows stat() for path
      component traversal without exposing directory contents via
      readdir(). Without at least metadata access, even reaching an
      allowed subpath can fail with EPERM during traversal.

    Working directory & repo:
      $CWD (subpath)        — full read-write to the project
      $REPO_ROOT (subpath)  — read-only; the repo root, which may
                              differ from CWD if CWD is a subdirectory
      $GIT_DIR (subpath)    — the .git dir (may be outside repo root
                              for worktrees)

    rwDirs / rwFiles:
      Each gets a (allow file-read* file-write* ...) rule. Dirs use
      (subpath ...) so all contents are accessible. Files use
      (literal ...) for exact-path access only.

  ## Debugging tips

    "Operation not permitted" / "denied by sandbox":
      macOS logs sandbox violations to the system log. Query them:
        log show --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "deny"' --last 5m
      Each entry shows the denied operation and path, telling you
      exactly which (allow ...) rule is missing.

    TLS / HTTPS failures ("SecureTransport" or "errSecInternalComponent"):
      Usually means a Mach service or keychain path is blocked:
      - Check that com.apple.securityd.xpc and com.apple.trustd.agent
        are in the mach-lookup allows.
      - Check that /Library/Keychains and /private/var/db/mds are
        readable.

    "sandbox-exec: ... (os/kern) invalid argument":
      Syntax error in the .sb profile. Inspect the built file:
        cat /nix/store/...-<outName>-sandbox.sb
      Common causes: unmatched parens, bad regex syntax, or a
      (param "X") with no corresponding -D X=value flag.

    Agent can't find tools / PATH is empty:
      PATH is set to the Nix-built basePath from allowedPackages.
      It is NOT inherited from the parent shell. If a tool is missing,
      add its package to allowedPackages.

    Git operations fail:
      GIT_DIR is auto-detected via git rev-parse. If you're outside
      a repo, it falls back to /nonexistent-git-dir (a harmless dummy
      that satisfies the (param "GIT_DIR") reference without granting
      access to anything real).

    NOTE: sandbox-exec is deprecated by Apple and may be removed in a
    future macOS release. It still works as of macOS 15 (Sequoia) but
    produces no deprecation warnings at runtime — only the man page
    mentions it. There is no supported replacement for unprivileged
    sandboxing on macOS.
